# Image Processing Collage Project
## Overview
This Python project applies various image processing techniques to an image, generating multiple filtered versions and displaying them in a collage. The program utilizes an image library to manipulate pixel values and create effects such as grayscale, sepia, edge detection, and more.

## Features
- Grayscale Conversion: Converts an image to grayscale.
- Sepia Filter: Applies a sepia tone to an image.
- Edge Detection: Highlights edges in an image using Sobel filtering.
- Negative Filter: Inverts the colors of an image.
- RGB Swap Filter: Swaps red, green, and blue channels for a unique color effect.
- Horizontal Flip: Flips the image along the Y-axis.
- Mirror Effect: Mirrors half of the image over the Y-axis.
- Blur Filter: Applies a blur effect to the image.
- Collage Generation: Arranges the original and modified images on a black background.

## Usage
1. Clone or download my code.
2. Run collage_maker.py
3. If you would like to try the code with another image, replace flower.jpg with another file placed in the same folder as collage_maker.py. `img = image.FileImage("flower.jpg")`
